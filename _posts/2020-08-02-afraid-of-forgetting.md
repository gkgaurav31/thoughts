I paniced when I could not remember my old house a few days back. The place where are stayed for more than a decade. It was a frightening feeling. I do not have a good memory for sure. I remember an instance as a child when I had already studied a chapter from our History book and I had also made some notes from that chapter. After that chapter was taught again in school and I came back home to read it. I did not realize that I had already read it before. It just gave me a Deja-vu feel. Something I'd done before, but I was definitely not sure about it. It was only after I saw my notes from that chapter that I realized that I had almost forgotten about it. It was pretty unbelievable for me. I have been using some tricks to remember stuffs since that time. I do not rely on my memory for sure. So, I try to remember things by making them obvious. That works pretty well actually. That helps me to understand the concepts in a better way, I think. Instead of just memorizing things now, I try to co-relate them, and come to a logical conclusion. So, even when I would have forgotten the final result, I can use my common sense to come to that point. This has helped me quite a lot in my work as well. As I tend not to just mug up some fancy words, rather, I try to understand what goes behind it and make it obvious.  

However, I am still afraid of forgetting people. I'm okay if I do not remember a few things which I would have done in the past. That is still okay for me. However, I am afraid that I might start forgetting people. I am already bad at remembering names. I am also bad at recalling people who I would have met previously. Being an introvert, I have another tendency of not mingling with people so much.  

Some days back, I called my sister randomly to talk to her. I felt so bad that we did not have anything good to talk about. We have lost that connection. We don't know anything that's going on in each others life. And I felt realy bad about it. We are siblings. We should at least have SOMETHING to talk about ANYTIME. I guess, it's just that we have been so much apart from each other in these years that we really don't know each other. I think I should fix this. I should talk to people more. Work cannot be an excuse for not being in contact with your family. There are not many people I talk to.  

I am glad that I write down my thoughts here. I gives me so much clarity in my thoughts.
