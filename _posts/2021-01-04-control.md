> I am lazy but I have started loving cycling.

"You've become so fat."  

"You need to start dieting and working out."  

"You are growing bigger day by day. You used to be so thin. I can hardly recognize you now."  

And I have personally been asking myself everyday - why have I become so lazy?  

Probably the worst part is that none of that changed me even a bit. I have been procrastinating, abusing myself, getting frustrated, getting disappointed each day. And yet, I have never been able to just get out of my fucking bed.  

What I have realized recently is that you need __A REASON__. Sometimes, that reason can be as tiny as someone calling you fat (in a casual way). Sometimes, it can be a life changing event for you - the realization that __YOU CONTROL YOUR LIFE__.  

For me, it was the latter one. I have been relatively thin for most of my lifetime. And I eventually became obese. So, I know for a fact that people will keep commenting whether you are "thick or thin". So, probably that's the reason what others says doesn't really bother me. It does make me think. It makes me plan. But I tend to procrastinate after that.

In the past couple of weeks, there are things which have not been going so great in my life. Let's just say, that certain external factors have been affecting me a lot. It has shattered my peace of mind. When that happens, I really can't keep calm. I get pissed off due to small things. I start noticing problems - even when they don't exist. I start overthinking. And sometimes, I over react. I hate that. I hate being that person. I have been that person in the past and I have tried my best to not repeat that mistake. I have improved since then. I have had better control over myself and my anger. However, recently, I have been losing it. I realize it very well that I need to get my control back.  

You might be wordering how all of this is related to cycling. Well, the thing is, I took a step forward to (finally) to work on my health. The decision is obviously good. While I was cycling, I realized, I had the control over that thing. I could __DECIDE__ where I wanted to go. I could go as fast as I wanted to go, or just stop by. I could go to places I'm afraid to go because I am not that great at remembering places. Thanks to Google Map without which you would have seen my posters all over the country. I don't know if you get this, but the realization that you control your life is very significant. You cannot control other people or things. Like, you cannot control if it will rain tomorrow. However, you can control how you __REACT__ to that event. Maybe you can have a backup plan. Or maybe, you can just enjoy the rain (Something which I would prefer). Staying frustrated, getting pissed off or being depressed is not going to help you. Controlling your emotions and your reactions will.

So the choice is yours. You need to decide if you want to __grab those handles and control them.__
