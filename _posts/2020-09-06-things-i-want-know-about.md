I will be shifting to a new home next week. The currently place where I stay, BTM 2nd Stage, it has been nice. There is a lake next to my home - Madiwala Lake. It's very peaceful here. A while ago, before I started writing this blog, I was standing at the balcony and I could hearing the voices of crickets. The breeze makes is so peaceful.  

There are so many things in the world which we do not know. I am not a guy who follow the recent affairs proactively. It's totally upon my interest. If something interests me, I could spend days researching about it. There I times when I think I should be aware about certain things though. Sometimes, I think about it but I tend to not bother about it later. So, I came up with this idea that I will keep a list of things I WANT to know about. I will keep updating the list. When I complete reading about it, I'll cross it out. Maybe, I could write down about it in this blog itself. For now, I'll not limit the topics to any specific area. So, I'll include everything in a single list. Let's see how this goes.

#### MY LIST - THINGS I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT

- What GDP exactly and what are the factors affecting it
- How does a Flash Drive work? How is it possible to save any image, file onto any drive?
- What makes a premium earphone/headphone better than others?
- Well, Indian Politics in general
- And also Indian History (Important things to remember)
