A moment back I realized that I keep thinking and talking about things that I don't like. Rather, I should be sharing things I love about you. That there's really a lot to say here. To be completely honest, I am also writing this to let you know how imporant you are in my life and give you at least one reason to stay. I don't do a good job in showing that, but it doesn't mean that I don't value you. Anyway, I'll try to keep to keep this not-so-short, so that you can really see the effort I took. :smirk:

It took me less than 5 seconds to come up with the title of this post. Obviously, you are wonderful, and make my life amazing as well. I feel lucky to have you in my life, and even luckier that you ended up being my girlfriend. It has been an amazing journey till now, and I am pretty sure that we'll have even better days going forward. I don't care if we fight over petty issues. I don't care if you shout at me or abuse me (well, some times). I just care about one thing, and that is to know whether I mean something to you.  

I read a story some time back about a pet dog. So, there was this dog called Doggy (his owner wasn't so brilliant at naming :stuck_out_tongue:). One day, Doggy's owner, Alex got a call from his office that he has been offered to go to US for his new position. Alex was very excited and he had to leave for his new life just the next week. Doggy was a pretty intelligent dog, and he realized that Alex is going to leave him. He obviously didn't know till when. Alex left and Doggie kept waiting for his return. The other people in his family were good, and they took care of him. But Doggy wanted to play with Alex, and he missed him badly. After a very long couple of years, Alex finally got back. Doggy was ***really*** happy to see him. He wagged his tail, ran after Alex and started licking him all over. The point is, __if there is love, nothing else matters.__ :heart:

You have always been there when I needed someone. We hardly knew each other when you gave me your shoulder to cry on. You could have just texted me *"Everything will be okay, don't worry."*. Like my other closer friends. But you stayed. And you listened. I will always be grateful for that. I do realize that I have myself not been able to come close to that when you needed me, and I am guilty for that.  

Other than the fact that you have always been there for me, I should definitely mention that the most amazing part I admire about you, is your independence. I can't find a better word, so let me try to explain it. I've mostly been a Mumma's boy. So, handling everything on my own is something I really find amazing. I remember that you told me that you had come to the college all by yourself for your admission. I had my complete family with me. And, I could never imagine myself alone that time. So, it was kinda unbelievable for me.

There are numerous other small things that I could keep writing about. I don't want to do that here because I want to share it directly with you, and see your expression when I tell you that.

I want to let you know that you are the best thing which has happened in my life. I don't know how things will be after some years, but trust me, I will keep trying to make things better. ***Always.***
