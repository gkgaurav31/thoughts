You must have heard this popular quote -

> Give a man a fish, you will feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will feed himself for lifetime.  

The idea sounds quite perfect with the assumptions -

1) The person who is giving that fish wants to teach how to fish and is capable of doing it.

2) The person who is taking the fish is interested to learn.

I will give you an analogy. Think about your work-life. Assume that you have a task which is very challenging. You try very hard to solve a specific bug which seemed very easy when you started. After struggling a lot, you seek for help from your peers. One of your colleagues was able to fix the bug after some analysis. Now, you have two options. You can simply take the solution and commit it to your code. The seconds option, which is also the ideal one, learn how your colleague solved it. The second option is crucial for your learning. The solution is not so imporant sometimes. If you know "how to think", you can solve it yourself. At the same time, we do need to consider the effort the second person has put it. He has all the rights to say that he is busy and will get back to you later.  

There is also a side effect of this whole "learn how to fish". Sometimes, you just delay the things because you keep waiting for other person to explain something to you. In this case, you could have avoided further work by expecting your colleague to help again. You become dependent on him, which is bad, of course. The point is, the quote we are talking about is not wrong, but there are certain assumptions which are not always valid in the real world.
