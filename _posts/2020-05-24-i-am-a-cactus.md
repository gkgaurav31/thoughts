I am a Cactus. I do not need much water to stay alive. I can live in extreme conditions, in places where people generally strive.
I mean no harm to others. Often, I hurt people. I hurt people who come close to me, as I have so many spines.  

It's never intentional. I cannot remove those spines - it's just who I am. To be with me, I guess, you have to maintain a distance.
When you love and care for someone, that is difficult. But, hugging me will just cause you pain. This is just who I am. I am a Cactus.
